  ```json
  "homepage": "https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/3d-pacman-game"
  ```

### 2. Initial Git Setup (if not done)
```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/3d-pacman-game.git

# Add all files
git add .

# Make initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: 3D Pac-Man game with compass controls"
```

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.com
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
5. Save the changes

### 5. Automatic Deployment

## Testing on Mobile
